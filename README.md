# Keylogger

I have created a simple Keylogger in python which records all the keys pressed and stores them in a text file.

I have used a 3rd party module named "pynput"
> pynput : This library allows you to control and monitor input devices. Currently, mouse and keyboard input and monitoring are supported.

* In Windows it can be installed by using command in command prompt
```
pip install pynput
```

* In Linux it can be installed by using following command 

```
sudo apt -y install python3-pynput
```

Note : If pip related error occurs then reinstall pip and try again installing pynput
